        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a backend developer with experience building APIs and scalable systems.
            I enjoy solving real-world problems and working with clean architecture.
            Currently, I am focused on improving my full-stack development skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            My approach to engineering is practical and product-driven. I care about speed, but not at the expense
            of reliability. I prefer solutions that are easy to reason about, easy to test, and easy for teams to
            maintain as the project evolves over time.
        </p>

                <h3>Foundation in Core Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    I started by strengthening core programming fundamentals, data structures, and problem solving.
                    That foundation helped me write clear logic and debug complex behavior confidently.

                <h3>Backend Specialization</h3>
                <p>
                    I moved into API development with Python and FastAPI, focusing on validation, error handling,
                    authentication flows, and database integration using clean service boundaries.

                <h3>Production and Scalability</h3>
                <p>
                    As projects matured, I worked more on deployment workflows, monitoring, and performance tuning.
                    This phase taught me to design for operability from day one, not after release.

                    <h4>Clarity Over Cleverness</h4>
                    <p>
                        Readable code and explicit interfaces reduce future bugs and onboarding time.
                        I optimize for team velocity across months, not just one sprint.

                    <h4>Measure Before Optimizing</h4>
                    <p>
                        I use profiling and metrics to find actual bottlenecks before tuning.
                        This keeps performance work targeted and avoids unnecessary complexity.

                    <h4>Small Iterations</h4>
                    <p>
                        I break work into reviewable increments with tests, which lowers risk and improves feedback.
                        Frequent delivery creates momentum and faster product learning.

                    <p>
                        I include logging, alerting, and clear runbooks early. Reliable operations are part of
                        engineering quality, especially when traffic and user impact increase.

            <h2>Current Focus</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently improving full-stack execution by pairing backend depth with better frontend delivery.
                My goal is to build complete products where architecture, user experience, and deployment quality are
                aligned from the start. I am also investing more time in system design documentation, security best
                practices, and reproducible development environments for team consistency.
